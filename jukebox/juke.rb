#Your Jukebox constructor should take in a playlist of songs as an argument. This playlist represents the songs that you are requesting the jukebox to play.

#Like any good jukebox, it is limited to a certain set of songs that it can actually play. Below is the list of songs the jukebox has to offer. Your constructor should eliminate any songs from your requested playlist that are not on this list:


# Implement a play! instance method that takes the first song on the list and removes it from the playlist permanently. Upon calling this method, the playing song should be returned in your terminal.

# Implement a shuffle_songs! method that randomizes the order of your playlist.

# Implement an add_track instance method that requires one argument, the name of the track. If the song is in list of available songs, your software should add the song the the end of the playlist and return true. If the song is not found on the list, it should just return false.
