##in this excercise I want to write a loop that accepts user inputs and adds them, prompting if they have anything else to add befrore providing the sum.

#require 'pry'
# value = 0
# continue = true
#
# while continue == true do
#     puts "please input a value to sum"
#     new_value = gets.chomp.to_i
#     value = value + new_value
#
#     puts "would you like to input another value"
#     input = gets.chomp
#    binding.pry
#     if input == "f"
#         continue == false
#         puts "the sum of your values is #{value}"
# end
# end


# checking multiple conditionals to see if the loop should continue
# run while loop prompting user for input while either the tax or registration is due

tax_due = true
reg_due = true

while (tax_due || reg_due) do
    if tax_due
        puts "please pay taxes (y/n)"
        payment = gets.chomp
        if payment == "y"
            tax_due = false
            puts "thank you for payment"
end
else
    puts "please pay registration (y/n)"
    payment = gets.chomp
    if payment == "y"
        reg_due = false
        puts "ok you're all squared away"

    end
end
end
